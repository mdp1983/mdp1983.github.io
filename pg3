<div id="A Little About Me">

<p>I am 38 years old, married with 4 boys.  I graduated from _Smithton_ H.S. in 2002.  
    I love to play the drums, all though there is no time anymore with a new baby.  
    The house is quite full and we are always busy.  My older two boys are into football and baseball.  
    I coach my own U12 competitive baseball team.  My older boys and I like garden tractor pulling, <a href ="https://ngtps.org"> check out The National Garden Tractor Pulling Series</a>.
